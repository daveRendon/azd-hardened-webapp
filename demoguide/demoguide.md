Once you deploy the environment, you should be able to:

Task 1: Validate the Microsoft Sentinel configuration
Task 2: Validate the connection of Azure Activity to Sentinel
Task 3: Validate the rule that uses the Azure Activity data connector.
Task 4: Review the playbook
Task 5: Manage custom alerts and configure the playbook as an automated response.
Task 6: Invoke an incident and review the associated actions.
